# Relieve a Fortnite Dance - $FORT

This is a sample web project that generates a random Fortnite dance for each user.  
It's meant to demonstrate how you can integrate fun animations and a "crypto" concept on a GitHub-hosted page.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter your name, click the chest, and enjoy your exclusive dance.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Push your code to a new GitHub repository.
2. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (or find “Pages” in the left sidebar).
4. Under **Source**, select the branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the root folder.
5. Click **Save**.
6. You’ll get a GitHub Pages URL. Share it with friends!

## Customization
- **Images**: Replace the placeholder images (`via.placeholder.com`) with Fortnite-themed images or GIFs.
- **Dances**: Modify the `dances` array in `script.js` to include your own dances or animations.
- **Styles**: Edit `style.css` to achieve the desired look and feel for your brand/theme.
